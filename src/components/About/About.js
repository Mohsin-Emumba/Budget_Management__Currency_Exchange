                        Currency trading is a 24-hour market that is only closed from Friday evening to Sunday evening,
                        but the 24-hour trading sessions are misleading. There are three sessions that include the Euro
                        pean, Asian and United States trading sessions. Although there is some overlap in the sessions,
                        the main currencies in each market are traded mostly during those market hours.Traders who stay with pairs
                        based on the dollar will find the most volume in the U.S. Thanks again.</p>
